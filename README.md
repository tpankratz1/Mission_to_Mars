# Mission to Mars

## Summary

BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images from a web site. This scraped data was stored on a Mongo database. A web application was used to display the data, and then the design of the web app was altered to accommodate the images.
